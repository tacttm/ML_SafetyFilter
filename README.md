# Safety Filter

## Description
-----------
Safety Filter is a machine learning model developed using Create ML, designed to classify images as NSFW (Not Safe For Work) or SFW (Safe For Work). The primary goal of the model is to assist in creating a safe online environment by automatically filtering out undesirable content. It can be useful for developers, content moderators, or anyone looking to automate image screening processes.

## Terms of Use
------------
The model is provided "as is" without any warranties of accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Classifying NSFW/SFW content is a complex task, and the model is not perfectâ€”it may make mistakes (e.g., false positives or misses). It is recommended to use it as a supplementary tool alongside other verification methods, not as a standalone solution. You are free to use, copy, modify, distribute, and integrate the model into any projects, including commercial ones, under the MIT License.

**By downloading, installing, or using the Safety Filter model, you explicitly agree to these terms of use.**

## Limitations and Warnings
------------------------
- **Accuracy**: The model does not guarantee 100% accuracy and may misclassify images. Users assume all risks associated with its use.
- **Purpose**: The model is intended solely for filtering and protecting against unwanted content. The author does not endorse or bear responsibility for its use for other purposes, including misuse or reverse application (e.g., searching for NSFW content).
- **Data**: The model was trained on publicly available data from open sources. It does not contain personal data or confidential information, but the author is not liable for any interpretations or conclusions drawn from analyzing the model.
- **Bias**: Like all machine learning models, Safety Filter may exhibit biases present in its training data. It may perform differently across various demographic groups, content types, or cultural contexts. Users should be aware of these potential biases when implementing the model.
- **Liability**: The author is not responsible for any consequences of using the model, including but not limited to classification errors, financial losses, reputational damage, or legal claims.

## Technical Details
-----------------
- **Format**: The model is provided in the .mlmodel format, compatible with Core ML (tested on Apple devices).
- **Input**: Supports standard image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- **Requirements**: Requires Xcode or another Core ML-compatible environment for integration.
- **Updates**: This model is provided as a one-time release (v1.0). There is no scheduled maintenance or update plan. Users are encouraged to retrain or fine-tune the model for their specific needs if required.
- **Support**: The author does not provide technical support or updates. Users are responsible for integrating and testing the model in their projects.
